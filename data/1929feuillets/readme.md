- **Description**. This work does not have parts. There are more than 50 diary entries (class `MsPart`) reused in *Feuillets*. We know of two avant-textes of this work: a clean copy by the poet and the annotated proofs. *Feuillets* reuses two previous articles, both entitled "Notes" and published in the journal *La Revue romande*, in 1919 and in 1921. It exists one avant-texte of the latter (a clean copy of *Prière*); the article also includes three diary entries from the trip to Italy.    *Feuillets* is part of the complete works published in 1950, *Écrits*. For this occasion, the text has been changed: other extracts from previous articles have been included (again from "Notes" 1921, plus other four articles published in the journal *Aujourd'hui* in 1930-31), as well as 15 diary entries dating back to 1916-1923. There are two avant-textes of the 1950 edition: the annotated 1929 edition and a list of texts to be included in the new edition.
