- **Description**. This book is composed of two parts (class `PubPart`), a verse poem and a prose poem. For the first one, we know of two avant-textes (documents MS 1 A/1a and MS 1 A/1b) and a previous publication in 1922 or 1923. The second part reuses three diary entries (two of class `MsPart` and one `Manuscript`) and has two avant-textes (one in a private collection, one in Roud archive). There are two avant-textes of the whole work, both in a private collection. The first part of *Adieu* has been used in a later article ("Annonce d'un adieu", 1932), for which there is one avant-texte in Simond's archive. The book has been republished in 1944, for a new publisher. The second part of *Adieu*, the prose poem, is also included in the 1950 volumes *Ã‰crits*.
