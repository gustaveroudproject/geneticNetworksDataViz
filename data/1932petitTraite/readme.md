- **Description**. This book is composed of eight parts (class `PubPart`). The first part reuses four previous articles published in the journal *Aujourd'hui*; for the latter article, we have the annotated proofs. The second, third, fourth, sixth and eighth parts also reuse previous articles. The fifth part of the book, "Réveil rêvé", reuses a previous article and we have a draft of it. The seventh reuses two previous articles. Various diary notes have been resued in the book. We also have the proofs of the entire book. The text is included in the complete works published in 1950, *Écrits*. A section of the first part has been reused in an article published in 1967.
