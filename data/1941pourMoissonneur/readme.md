- **Description**. There is one typed document of the entire book. The work has six parts: a sort of preface and five poems (in prose or verse). Various avant-textes of each part are kept in the archives. The text reuses some (not many) diary notes. Three of the five poems have been already published in articles.   The text is included in the 1950 complete works edition.  Some parts of the collection have been reused for further publications before and after 1950.
