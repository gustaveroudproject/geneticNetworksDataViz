- **Description**. The book is composed of three sections: "I. Nuit", "II. Année", "III. Fin". No previous publication has been used in this work. The reuse of diary materials happens essentially in the second part, integrating notes mainly from the year 1932. In the archive of La Chaux-de-Fonds, there are two avant-texts of the first two parts. In the archive of Étienne Chevalley, there is a draft and the corrected proofs of the second part only.      *Essai pour un paradis* is included in the 1950 edition of the complete works of Roud. In this edition, some sections of the second part ("II. Année") are removed or changes title. A portion of a previous article is used in the 1950 edition, at the end of the second section.      Various parts of the second section have been republished in articles after the publication of the book in 1933; one of these articles, published in 1939, has been further reused. Documents preparing some of these publications are kept in the archives.
